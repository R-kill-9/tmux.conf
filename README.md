# tmux.conf
This is my tmux.conf file, you may not like the colors but they can be easily changed.


## Commands
- The prefix has been remap from 'C-b' to 'C-a'.
- Alt-arrow to switch panes, without using prefix.
- Mouse interaction has been enabled
- 'C-a-r' if you want to reload the configuration file.
