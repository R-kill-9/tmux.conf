# tmux.conf
This is my tmux.conf file, you may not like the colors but they can be easily changed.

## Commands
- The prefix has been remap from 'C-b' to 'C-a'.
- Alt-arrow to switch panes, without using prefix.
- Mouse interaction has been enabled
- 'C-a-r' if you want to reload the configuration file.
- If you want to copy some text you can use the default tmux option or Shift+Select with the mouse.
- If you want to kill all the active tmux sessions use: 
  ```bash
  tmux kill-server
  ```
